## Why

One of the questions we wanted to address for our proposal was how can we get new and existing average trading consumer to be more engaged and informed with their investments.  Often new users are lost at the financial data presented in front of them and want to see information presented infront of them in a manner that is easy to understand. They also might want to know the possible future price range that the stock might be priced at later on.  

## Our Solution

In this repo, our solution is to use different APIs and stock data to bring forward an app, which brings stock price info to the common consumer through easy-to-understand visualizations.  They will receive data analytics based off 21 days and 200 days moving average and beta as well as Monte Carlo simulations that will make understanding stock risk and projection much easier.
From there, we can send the conclusive info directly to the consumer's phone through SMS messaging.


The final draft of our coding can be found in the file labeled, "Main-Notebook.ipynb". The presentation slideshow can be found in Baccarat_Presentation.pptx.

Any and all other files show the steps we took to arrive at our final product.
