In this repo, we will use different APIs and data to bring forward an app that brings stock price info to the common consumer through easy-to-understand visualizations.
From there, we can send the conclusive info directly to the consumer's phone through SMS messaging.

The final draft of our coding can be found in the file labeled, "Main-Notebook.ipynb". The presentation slideshow can be found in Baccarat_Presentation.pptx

Any and all other files show the steps we took to arrive at our final product.
